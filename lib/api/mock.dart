These bright white spots reflect excess heat back into space and keep the planet cooler. In theory, the Arctic remains colder than the equator because more of the heat from the sun is reflected off the ice, back into space.\\n\\nGlaciers around the world can range from ice that is several hundred to several thousand years old and provide a scientific record of how climate has changed over time. Through their study, we gain valuable information about the extent to which the planet is rapidly warming. They provide scientists a record of how climate has changed over time.\\n\\nToday, about 10% of land area on Earth is covered with glacial ice. Almost 90% is in Antarctica, while the remaining 10% is in the Greenland ice cap.\\n\\nRapid glacial melt in Antarctica and Greenland also influences ocean currents, as massive amounts of very cold glacial-melt water entering warmer ocean waters is slowing ocean currents. And as ice on land melts, sea levels will continue to rise.","createdAt":"2021-06-04T21:37:18.879Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-04T21:37:18.879Z","tagList":[],"description":"Why are glaciers and sea ice melting?","author":{"username":"maximsan","bio":null,"image":"https://static.productionready.io/images/smiley-cyrus.jpg","following":false},"favorited":false,"favoritesCount":0},{"title":"fsaasafs","slug":"fsaasafs-hg0dhk","body":"afsasfasf","createdAt":"2021-06-04T20:34:36.420Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-04T20:34:36.420Z","tagList":["fassaffas"],"description":"asfsasfasf","author":{"username":"вфfsafasfsa","bio":null,"image":"https://static.productionready.io/images/smiley-cyrus.jpg","following":false},"favorited":false,"favoritesCount":0},{"title":"saddasdas","slug":"saddasdas-whqlhw","body":"dsadasads","createdAt":"2021-06-04T20:34:11.172Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-04T20:34:11.172Z","tagList":["adsdas"],"description":"dasdasasd","author":{"username":"вфfsafasfsa","bio":null,"image":"https://static.productionready.io/images/smiley-cyrus.jpg","following":false},"favorited":false,"favoritesCount":0},{"title":"аваы","slug":"-4aj8tc","body":"ваывыфаыф","createdAt":"2021-06-04T19:17:52.050Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-04T19:17:52.050Z","tagList":["выаффыа"],"description":"ваыфафы","author":{"username":"sdadf1","bio":null,"image":"https://static.productionready.io/images/smiley-cyrus.jpg","following":false},"favorited":false,"favoritesCount":0}],"articlesCount":500}';
